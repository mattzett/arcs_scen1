**WARNING:  under construction**

This repository contains scripts for testing of ARCS mission scenario 1 data processing, i.e.  for converting maps of parallel current density and electric field into fields of conductance, hence characteristic energy and total energy flux.  

## Basic concept

Combine current continuity and Poynting thm. (EM conservation laws) to allow simultaneous estimation of the Pedersen and Hall conductances.  

**NOTE**:  Use of Poynting thm. in steady state needs to be justified or discussed in the context of the literature

Convert Pedersen and Hall current into Q,E_0 through Robinson formulas or other model-dependent parameterizations
